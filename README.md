## My Process

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS

### What I Learned

This is the first challenge I have done on Frontend Mentor, so much of my time was getting used to the format.

The challenge itself was pretty straight-forward, a pretty simple layout. I was able to get very close without looking at the design file, then had to do some minor tweaking.

I tried playing with flexbox more than what I have in the submitted work. For a simple design like this I found it less complicated to just line up the elements.

This is also the first time I have spent time working on a README. Having the template helped.


### Continued Development

Going forward is practice. I had not settled on frontend development as what I wanted to specialize in until recently. I need to learn more js, and I have a couple of personal projects in mind.

Kevin Powell - I just found Kevins content and going through his space website course has helped me conceptualize the process of development much easier. My css structure is based on his css from that course.
